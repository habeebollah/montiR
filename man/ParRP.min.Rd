\title{Function used in the minimizing process to calculate standard error in Schaefer's management parameter}
\usage{
ParRP.min(inpars, df, OWT = FALSE, currentF = 0.7, weight = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{inpars}{management parameters which consist of Bmsy (stock biomass at maximum
sustainable yield), MSY (maximum sustainable yield), Emsy (effort at maximum sustainable yield), B0 (biomass when fishing is started)
and s.sigma (observation error)}

\item{df}{dataframe containing three columns; year, catch and effort. A fourth column with biomass should be added
if OWT (One Way Trip) option uses "Biomass"}

\item{OWT}{is CPUE plot showing One Way Trip pattern? The default is FALSE, but should be
replaced with either "Biomass" or "Depletion" when the plot shows One Way Trip type of data}

\item{currentF}{Current exploitation rate collected from other survey.}

\item{weight}{weight given to the deviation between observed and predicted value in either
biomass or exploitation rate.}
}
\value{
A penalized likelihood is used to fix the lack of contrast in One Way Trip type of data using Depletion or Biomass data.

The Biomass option in OWT is used when biomass time series data from acoustic or trawl survey is available and
should be added as the fourth columns in the input dataframe. The default weight when Biomass level is set at 0.9 with range
between 0-1 (lower accuracy with high variance as closer to 0, constrain the estimation procedure to fit the auxiliary
information as closer to 1)

The Depletion option in OWT uses current harvest rate from survey or expert knowledge as penalty.
Depletion range is between 0 to 1, where higher number represent higher depletion level. The default is 0.7 to
say that the depletion is high and many fish were caught. The default weight for harvest rate is 1000 and can be adjusted
so the predicted harvest rate reach a closest value to the current exploitation rate. Predicted harvest rate value
in each optimization step will show up when optimization process is being executed.

Input are  kept at initial value without using log() like the other minimization inputs. If
the fitted parameters resulting in minus value, use the constrained variables and "L-BFGS-B" optimization method,
and produce the standard error from hessian using steps in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27202395/how-do-i-get-standard-errors-of-maximum-likelihood-estimates-in-stan
